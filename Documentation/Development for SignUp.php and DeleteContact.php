when making the DeleteContact.php file, I mainly followed Gabriela's working files and looked
at the delete syntax for mySQL on w3schools.com.
	I did not find it to be very difficult, but there was an issue that was solved by copying and pasting
  the latter half of the commands (getRequestInfo downward) from AddContact.php.

	one issue i noticed was being unsure if I should try and have more parameters in the
	delete command than one, at first I decided to leave it at one with the only one being FirstName
	but I double checked at a lab.

SignUp.php was the same process as DeleteContact.php but instead of using a delete command in the
Contacts table, we are using an insert command in the Users table.
	This one was easier to complete since I had finished DeleteContact.php before making this one.
